simple starter website for chris

Hi Chris!  You're a CS major, and that means you should have your own site to play around with.  This is a basic guide to ezpz web development.  There are a bunch of things you can use, but here's what I use!

Domain:  I registered chriscebula.com for you.  For domains, namecheap.com tends to be the cheapest place to get one. 
	<b>GOAL</b>:  Create a namecheap account so that I can transfer the domain to you!

Hosting:  Even though you've got a domain, you probably want to put something on it.  There are several different options.  Personally, I'd go with Amazon Web Services.  If you register as a student with Amazon Web Services, you get a free micro-instance (which is enough to run your website year-round without paying a cent!).  
	GOAL:  Create a student AWS account.

Web-page:  So you've got a domain, and a place to host stuff, but you don't have stuff!  So you're going to want to set up something for people to see.  This is where HTML (and CSS) come in.  
	GOAL:  learn/review basic HTML  
	OPTIONAL:  learn/review basic CSS  (Hint:  all you really need so far is like some text)

Server:  Okay!  You've got a *really* basic page, but how do you get people to see it?  You need a server to serve up html pages, images, documents (like resumes), and anything else you want people to see.  I use node.js and express.js to do this.  Its super duper easy to do.  
	GOAL:  get a server running on localhost using node.js  
	GOAL:  change your .html file to .ejs and have it load on '/' from your server.
